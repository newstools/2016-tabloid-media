On Thursday afternoon, Netcare 911 paramedic Shaun Paul , Quinton from Specialised Rescue and Chris from Rescue Tech were called to the Phoenix area where a mother cat and her kitten was trapped in a storm water pipe since 8am Thursday morning.The Netcare 911 regional operations manager, Shaun Paul, was called first, and when he arrived, he found that it would be a very technical and long rescue operation. Realising that rain was predicted for Thursday night, he called for the assistance of Specialised Rescue and Rescue Tech.The rescue team used a specialised camera that was put into the pipe to locate the cats. With picks, shovels and angle grinders they worked for about four hours before they managed with a great relief to safely remove the cats from the storm water drain.Mommy and her kitten were then handed to the owner and great joy was seen on all the faces.&nbsp;
