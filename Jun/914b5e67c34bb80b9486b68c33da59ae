A blazing fire engulfed the Durban Christian Centre on Tuesday evening, with massive flames lighting up the city skyline as congregation members looked on in horror. Community members flooded social media with photos and videos of the fire from just after 6pm.Emergency services at the scene were unable to comment on the incident, or provide specific details as to the cause of the fire, or when it broke out, however, witnesses believe it may have been due to a power cut that had occurred earlier in the day. They are saying that the fire broke out as soon as the power came back on, said one bystander, who wished to remain anonymous. The fire started at the top of the building, by the blue lights. Other witnesses said they arrived at the scene to already find the fire devouring the church.Emergency services worked tirelessly to control the fire and, as the flames began to subside, members of the church began to pray and sing songs of worship while providing comfort support to those devastated by the fire s extensive damage.Reports from emergency services confirm that the flames at the church fire have been extinguished but the structure is still smoldering with hot spots. No injuries sustained.MORE PICS
