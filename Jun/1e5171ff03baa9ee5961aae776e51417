by Moe IsmailTraffic congestion, long queues and loud voices fill Sparks Road on a Sunday afternoon. It is that part of the day when people stream with the containers to collect the ever delicious unassailable haleem. There are several collection points on Sparks Rd on &#8220;Haleem Sundays&#8221; in Overport and many other parts of Durban.Is it a soup or a broth, or maybe both. It is hard to say except that it highly nutritious and soothing at the time of breaking the fast (ifthaar). And it is a tradition for the thousands of Muslims in Durban.It is also served in several mosques in small helpings at iftaar time, along with dates and other savouries. A lot of this is provided from well wishers in the community, and the haleem scooped out in bucket-loads is free.That is the incredible spirit of Ramadaan.Growing up in Johannesburg, haleem was almost unheard of for as long as I can remember, and it never quite took to the community as it does here in Durban.Yet, the irony is that Joburgers would often ask the Durbanites about the haleem, requesting that they bring some on their next visit to the Highveld.Enjoy!
