Two IFP members, Siyanda Mnguni and Thokozani Majola, were gunned down on Friday evening, 22 Friday 2016 in the uMtshezi area. The details of the shooting is not clear, but it is believed that the two IFP members had been out campaigning, when they were confronted by people wearing ANC t-shirts. According to Mr. Gwala, IFP National Chairperson, the men were stopped and shot at point blank range. We are concerned that as we near local government elections we are losing our members. These acts of killings do not only undermine the democratic right of voters but such acts are reversing the gains we have made in stabilising the province of KwaZulu-Natal . I was also informed that one leader of a certain political party drove through our volunteers and injured one of them with his car and he drove away. What makes us angry is that the police did not open a case of attempted murder and hit and run but they only opened a case of reckless driving. This is ridiculous. Action must be taken against these police officers, said IFP National Chairperson Mr Blessed Gwala, MPL.The IFP has made an appeal to the law enforcement agencies to investigate this incident speedily and bring to book those responsible for it, to set an example to those whose actions are directed against our democratic order in general, and free and fair elections in particular.The IFP calls on its members to remain calm and to allow police to investigate. The IFP would like to send its condolences to Mnguni and Majola families and stand fully behind them in the time of sorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
