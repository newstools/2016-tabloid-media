The SA Post Office warns members of the public to be on alert of a scam doing the rounds where customers are duped into depositing money into fraudulently opened Postbank accounts.This is how the scam works:The SA Post Office advises the public to ignore items of this nature when they receive them. Postbank, the SA Post Office or any of its other subsidiaries will never open an account on your behalf and request an activation fee. You should always be wary of any promises of large sums of winnings for competitions you never took part in. Also, you should know that you are probably being scammed in any situation where you are required to pay an amount of money upfront, either as an admin fee or for any other reasons, to access large sums of money.The SA Post Office is currently working with law enforcement agencies to trace the perpetrators of this scam and members of the public that with information are requested to call the police or the Post Office s Crime buster Hotline on 0800 020 070.
