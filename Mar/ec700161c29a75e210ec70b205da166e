Phoenix &#8216;pick&#8217; murder accused, Derek Memele, believed to be in his 20&#8217;s, made his first appearance in the Verulam Magistrates Court today and is said to have been granted bail of a R1, 000. A well-informed source told the Phoenix Tabloid that Memele has three other court cases pending currently. The family and friends of murder victim, Ricky Reddy, 46 of Hexham, are indignant. The accused will re-appear in court on April, 16, 2016. The incensed Reddy family is calling for members of the community to support them in a protest to be held outside court on that day.Father killed in &#8216;pick&#8217; attack
