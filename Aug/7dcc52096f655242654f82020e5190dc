Tomorrow, millions of South Africans will have the opportunity to exercise their constitutional prerogative to vote for the leaders they believe will advance their interests in the Local Government Elections.The Local Government Elections are the most crucial elections in a democratic society as they provide locals with a choice to elect officials who will deliver basic services to them and further strengthen the democratic society that all South Africans believed in at the adoption of the Constitution in 1996.Nelson Mandela and others fought gallantly to ensure that in 1994 all South Africans (Black, White, Indian and Coloured) could vote. It was therefore crucial that when the new South Africa was born, these rights had to be included in the new Constitution.This Constitution, fashioned in the US Constitutional model, includes a Bill of Rights, which provides for the right of every citizen to vote, as Section 19 (3) (a) stipulates, &#8220;every adult citizen has the right to vote in elections for any legislative body established in terms of the Constitution and to do so in secret.&#8221;Local Government Elections were created to advance the principles of the democratic society, aptly captured in the slogan, &#8220;the people shall govern&#8221;. The people constitute ordinary citizens (voters), and that governance can be possible through the exercise of a right to vote.This democratic society that all South Africans agreed to pursue is there to protect and advance people&#8217;s interest, therefore, going to vote is a correct exercise in protecting democracy and advancing your interests as an ordinary citizens. It must never be mistaken that power lies with the politicians, real power lies in the hands of ordinary citizens, however, refusal to vote gives power to politicians!Tabloid Newspapers encourages all readers to go out in numbers to exercise their right to vote tomorrow, 3 August 2016.
