While the Proteas struggle to find form, our sights are set on The Weekly Gazette T10 Cup, which will see eight female teams go head to head at the Cato Manor Grounds on Saturday, 9 January.The Weekly Gazette T10 Cup is a unique and exciting competition solely for female cricketers of all ages and levels throughout KZN. The Cup has a similar structure to the IPL which will be played annually by 8 franchise teams. The tournament is aimed at creating a hype around women in cricket, to bring back the spark and excitement that some may lose over the years. As well as to encourage, promote and improve the level of cricket in KZN. Another key to this Cup is to develop current players and showcase new talent. Creating a greater filtration system and a larger pool of talented girls to choose from to represent KZN. Pool A is made up of Sun Runners, Wild Cats, KN Maulers and Fayes Angels, while Magic Knights, OnTime Eagles, JB Spartans and Super Queens make up Pool B. The day will be split into 12 games with winners from both pools fighting it out for top spot. Make your way down to Cato Manor Sports Grounds to show your support for the teams.Gates open at 9am and there will be food and drinks available.
