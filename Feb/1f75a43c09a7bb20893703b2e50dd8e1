Durban: KwaZulu-Natal Premier Senzo Mchunu has called on law enforcement agencies to move with speed and arrest suspects who are involved in the latest water-for-sale scandal. Mchunu who was visible angry and shocked made this call after receiving a tip off through the Premier s Hotline.According to the complainant, a driver of a water can truck belonging to Zululand District Municipality is charging R300 for a Jojo Tank. The driver who is operating after hours is raking in thousands of rands from desperate communities in Nongoma and surrounding areas. I am shocked and angry to say the least. This is scandalous and as government we believe that those who are involved in this water for sale scandal should be classified as criminals who are stealing state resources. Any maladministration of resources destined for communities affected by drought will be a source of anger and frustration especially for the unemployed and poor people. When we talk about being loyal to the Constitution of the Republic and its people it is when we are able to use government as an instrument to better the lives of the people. KwaZulu-Natal is the most affected province in South Africa as rainfall records show that 2014 and 2015 was one of the driest years since 1960. Whilst we appreciate the support from national government, I am calling upon the leadership in various municipalities to take full responsibility of resources destined for the poor. I want to encourage communities who have been duped into paying for water delivered by government s water cans to phone 0800 596596 to report such cases.
