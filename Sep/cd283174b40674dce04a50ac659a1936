By Se-Anne Rall A driver is expected to be charged with culpable homicide following a fatal crash along Florida Road this morning. It is alleged that the girl and her mother were dropped off by her father at the side of the road. The learner reportedly shouted that she had forgotten something in her father&#8217;s vehicle and went back to get it. It is believed that as she turned to cross the road again, she was struck by a vehicle driving down the busy road. The learner succumbed to her injuries and died at the scene. The girl&#8217;s family arrived at the scene and we&#8217;re extremely emotional. Berea SAPS are investigating further.
