They can also check the status of their special vote application online at http://www.elections.org.zaThe traditional method of applying for a special vote at local IEC offices by submitting a MEC35 form is also still available. Forms must be hand-delivered but can be delivered on behalf of a voter by someone else.The process for casting a special vote is the same as a normal vote with the exception that the completed ballot papers are sealed in an unmarked envelop which is then marked with the voter s name, ID number and voting district (VD) number. IEC officials take the envelope and place it in a secure ballot box for special votes and the voter s name is marked off the voters roll with SV to indicate a special vote.Once voting on Election Day has ended, the outer envelopes of the special votes are discarded and the ballot papers are removed from the unmarked inner envelope and then counted as part of the counting process for all ballots.
