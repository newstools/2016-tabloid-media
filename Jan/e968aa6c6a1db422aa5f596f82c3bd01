KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Education, Peggy Nkonyeni, has cautioned students and parents to be extra careful and guard against being conned by bogus institutions of higher education when registering ahead of the 2016 academic year.Nkonyeni said that, as students began to look for institutions of higher learning, delinquents would be ready to take advantage of unsuspecting students.&#8220;For years, many students have found themselves paying hefty amounts of money to non-existent schools,&#8221;said Nkonyeni, advising parents to take interest in the process of looking for schools for their children. Parents need to make sure that the schools where they register their children at, are fully registered with the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) and the Department of Higher Education and Training,&#8221; said Nkonyeni. &#8220;When registering at any institution of higher learning, students are advised to check the registration certificate of that institution.&#8221;Nkonyeni added that the registration certificate issued by the Department of Higher Education and Training must clearly show all the programmes each institution is accredited to offer.&#8220;If there is a programme that is not included in that certificate but which the institution promises to offer, students must know that they are being conned,&#8221; she said.To check the registration of institutions of higher learning, students are urged to visit www.dhet.gov.za or call 0800 873 2222. The website has all the names of institutions that are fully registered and operating legally.
