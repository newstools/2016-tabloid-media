It is with great sadness that we say bon voyage to our beloved Uncle Manny Gounden, a Sub-Editor at Tabloid Newspapers and internationally honoured SA Navy stalwart for decades. He succumbed to a short illness on Wednesday, leaving friends and family shocked and heartbroken. Hailing from Springfield, Manny had flown the South African naval flag high in his tenure from a seamen to PR Officer of the SA Navy. He had travelled extensively on international deployments on board the SA Navy Ships as a Public Relations Officer and Photo-Journalist. His deployments have taken him to Europe, South America, Africa and Asia. He had been decorated with 10, 20, 30, 40 year Good Service Medals, Southern Africa Medal, General Service Medal &amp; Unitas Medal. The French Navy awarded him with their National Defence Medal for his outstanding public relations and media support to the French Navy Ships in South Africa and abroad. His retirement from the navy was short lived, as he took up a Sub-editor position at Tabloid Newspapers, to keep himself occupied and was a great addition to the team. His wise words and fatherly advice will forever be etched in our minds. Our condolences go out to the family, especially his wife and 2 children. May God give you the courage and strength during this time of bereavement. The funeral will be held on Friday 4 November. His body will lie in state at his home in Bakerville Gardens, Seacowlake from 10:30am to 12 noon, then proceed to Clare Estate Crematorium.RIP O&#8217; Captain, my Captain
