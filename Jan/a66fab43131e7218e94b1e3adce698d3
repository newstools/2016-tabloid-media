Kharwastan Secondary achieved a 98.24% pass rate in the 2015 matric examinations. Principal V Pillay was ecstatic about the improvement, especially in the amount of Bachelor passes. &#8220;We obviously strive for 100%, but the quality of the passes are important.Our students are usually accepted to study engineering and other good courses. There has always been a high demand for Kharwastan learners in universities and this essentially proves the quality of any school. I would like to thank all staff and role-players for their continuous support to ensure that our school is the institution of excellence,&#8221; said Pillay.One learner, Husnaa Rasool, who scored 100% in Engineering, Graphics and Design (EGD) said, &#8220;I am so elated.
