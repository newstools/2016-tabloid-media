Judge Masipa has cited mitigating factors as her reasons for handing down a six-year jail sentence to disgraced paralympian, Oscar Pistorius.Pistorius was in court for the murder of his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, who is convicted of killing, on Valentine&#8217;s Day two years ago.&#8220;Punishment is not what you choose to do. It is something that is imposed on you. By it&#8217;s nature it is unpleasant, uncomfortable and painful. I have considered all the evidence, submissions and case law. &#8220;In the result, the sentence I impose on the accused in terms of murder dolus eventualis, is six years imprisonment,&#8221; Masipa said.
